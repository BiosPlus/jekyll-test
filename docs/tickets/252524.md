## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Feature Request:

It would be great if when creating a support ticket I could 'tag' additional admins on it so that they would also receive emails for updates.

Likewise it would be nice if I could 'subscribe/unsubscribe' from tickets I didn't open.

There are situations where multiple admins might want to be emailed about updates even if they aren't the person who opened the ticket.

On good example of this could be covering for vacations and holidays.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kevin
