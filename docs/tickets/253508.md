## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Feature Request

It would be very helpful if email notifications for ticket updates did not all have the same subject line: 'Your support ticket was answered by Mosyle Team'

I have multiple tickets open right now and it makes it hard to spot the replies that are most urgent to me when y'all are working hard and replying to a bunch of them in quick succession! (Which is appreciated.)

Simply having the title of the ticket as the subject line would be a great improvement.

Thanks,
Kevin
