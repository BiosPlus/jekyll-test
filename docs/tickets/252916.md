## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Feature Request

It would be very helpful to have an XML viewer in the Certificates / Custom Profiles section of the UI when viewing the details of a previously uploaded .mobileconfig file.

This would allow for anyone with 'View' permissions in that panel to inspect the content of the profile.

A bonus would be the ability to edit the XML and resave the profile if you have the 'Update' permission.

Thanks,
Kevin
