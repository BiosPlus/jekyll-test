## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

FEATURE REQUEST:

Mosyle automatically closes tickets after seven days if there hasn't been an update. This is very frustrating for unresolved tickets where the customer is simply waiting for a response from Mosyle about next steps.

Examples are: XXXXXX, XXXXXX

I understand the need to not prevent thousands of open tickets from piling up if customers abandon tickets. However it would be helpful to have an email sent before closure to give the customer an opportunity to comment and keep the ticket open.

Alternatively, implementing (#267977 - FR: Add functionality to reopen tickets) would negate the need for this since users could reopen an automatically closed ticket if needed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kevin
