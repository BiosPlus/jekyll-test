## Ticket Summary / Initial Message:

Heyo team,

The security rule `Configure Sudoers to authenticate on a Per -tty Basis` only seems to be recording compliance for devices which are on macOS 13.X, so the majority of our devices which are on 14+ are being reported as non-compliant, I did notice that on macOS 14+ the line: 'Defaults timestamp_timeout=0' is appended to the end of the /etc/sudoers file, which results in the same desired effect.

Just a heads up that there may need to be a change to the way this detection runs to factor in timestamp_timeout=0.

Our auditors will have a hard time buying into the rules effectiveness otherwise haha

Cheers!
