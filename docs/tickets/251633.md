## Ticket Summary / Initial Message:

Heyo team,

I've found a rather critical bug in the application/assignment of active security rules.

A few months ago I found that there were many rules which were not applying to our whole fleet, not a problem because the assignment/scope was to half of our fleet as was desired by the previous team caretaking the MDM. However at the time I used the Bulk Assignment function to reassign them to 'All Current and Future Devices'.

A few months on I've found that those rules while saying they're scoped to All Current and Future Devices, are actually still only applying/being tracked against the previous assignment.

Here are a list of the rules where this effect can be observed (on my tenancy):
- Disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity
- Disable Root login
- Enable 'Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar'
- Enable Auto Update
- Enable Library Validation
- Enable Signed System Volume
- Enable system security update installs
- Enable time synchronization daemon (timed)
- Enable to download new updates when available
- Enforce screen saver at login window
- Password: Don't allow simple value.
- Set Sudo timeout to 0
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) is Enabled
- Validate Install.log is retained for 365 days

For clarity, each of these state they are scoped to all devices, but are only being checked against ~46 out of the 98 total in our fleet.
Please feel free to jump into our instance and take a look. Not concerned about fixing them as I've tested that going into a rule with this issue can be remediated by going back into the assignment and doing a save, more concerned if there are other customers who may be experiencing the same without knowing.
