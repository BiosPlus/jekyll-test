## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

FEATURE REQUEST:

Please display each Administrator's Role in the list view.

Currently the Administrators panel list view displays 'Administrator' under each name. This is redundant since we are already in the Administrators panel.

It would be very helpful to take advantage of all the available space and also list the person's assigned role.

e.g. 'Administrator - Service Desk'

Right now if we want to audit RBAC levels we must click on every single user one at a time to view their Role in the right column.

(Additionally, Roles are not included in the Spreadsheet download of all administrators.)

It would be very nice to see everyone's role at a glance.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kevin
