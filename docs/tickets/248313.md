## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Heyo team! New feature req.

I noticed that running /Applications/Self-Service.app/Contents/MacOS/Self-Service from terminal opens an instance of self-serve for the duration of a script.
I have some internal tooling I would like to update via another script but rather than grabbing dependancies from the open web, I thought it would be swell to get Self Service to handle the installation on demand via CLI if the dependancy was missing.

So something like: `/Applications/Self-Service.app/Contents/MacOS/Self-Service --installpkg 'com.domain.package' --silent` or `/usr/local/bin/mosyle --reinstall 'com.domain.package'` would be a dream.

Unless there are some secret flags I can use with the existing self service binary, which I'd be keen to try out while acknowledging it voids any support reqs related to it haha
