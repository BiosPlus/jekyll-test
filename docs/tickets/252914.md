## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Feature Request:

It would be really helpful to have the ability to review logs from the Okta integration.

We have had several tickets where this would come in handy to help us evaluate situations without having to open a ticket and await a response.

Examples include: XXXXXX, XXXXXX, XXXXXX

Thanks,
Kevin
