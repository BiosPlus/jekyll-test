## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Heyo Team.

Throwing a feature request your way to contend with your competitors/cure FOMO.

Can we please get detection + remediation scripting? Good example of this is in intune/kandji implementations where a detection script can be run every so often, and an exit 1 results in there needing to be a remediation script run, once that remediation script is executed the detection is run again to check for an exit 0/success. This loop can be retried a few times (defined by the user) before either the device is marked non-compliant or a status thrown.

This would be a nice improvement as I'm currently using device groups to achieve this sort of function, the problem being that device groups as a remediation criteria aren't exactly timely in my view.
