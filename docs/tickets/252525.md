## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

Feature Request:

It is great that we can sort by specific columns in the Devices Overview, however it is annoying that there is no indicator of which column is being sorted or in what direction.

This could be easily resolved with some indicators as in my attached screenshots.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kevin
