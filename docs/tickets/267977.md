## Ticket Summary / Intial Message:

FEATURE REQUEST:

It would be very nice if customers had the ability to reopen a closed support ticket.

More than once I've had to open a brand new ticket in order to get clarification or ask a follow-up question about an existing, but now closed ticket.

This is a pretty standard feature with most ticketing systems I've used in the past and would be a welcome feature in Mosyle.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kevin
