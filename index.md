# Unofficial Mosyle Request Tracker

## Why does this exist?

This is a list of commonly requested features/bugs being made by administrators to the Mosyle support team.

Currently there is no publicly accessible roadmap available for requests, and tickets that are being logged are forwarded to a mysterious product team though never heard from again until maybe a release is made in their monthly updates.

By having a public list of requests, we hope to provide greater transparency on issues and features that have been raised by administrators like you, and maybe inspire the creation of an official public tracker.

## How do I contribute my support request to this page?

Easy, pop on over to the [github repo](https://github.com/BiosPlus/mosyle-request-list) and open either an issue or a pull request with the required information. There is a template file [here](https://github.com/BiosPlus/mosyle-request-list/blob/main/docs/templates/template.md?plain=1) which should be easy enough to follow.
